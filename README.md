Software Engineering - Mini Project 

Introduction:

Managing a society can be a complex and challenging task, especially for large-scale societies with numerous members. Keeping track of various aspects such as member registration, event scheduling, fee management, complaint handling, and visitor management can be quite challenging for society administrators. Therefore, a comprehensive society management system can streamline the management process and make it more efficient. In this article, we will discuss a free PHP project on Society Management System using PHP and MySQL that can help manage society affairs more efficiently.

Overview:

The Society Management System is a web-based application developed using PHP and MySQL, providing society administrators with a centralized platform to manage different society-related activities such as member registration, event management, fee management, complaint handling, visitor management, and notification management. The system is designed to handle all the necessary functions that a society management system requires. The system provides two different user types, i.e., administrator and member. The administrator has complete control over the system, while the member has access to their personal information and events.

Features:

Member Registration:

The system allows society administrators to register new members by capturing their personal details, contact information, and occupation. The system also generates a unique membership ID for each member.

Fee Management:

The system allows society administrators to manage membership fees, track payment history, and generate payment receipts.

Complaint Handling:

The system provides a complaint handling feature that allows members to register complaints related to society management. Society administrators can view and resolve complaints in the system.

Visitor Management:

The system allows society administrators to keep track of visitors entering and leaving the society. The system captures visitor details such as name, phone number, address, and person to meet.

Notification Management:

The system provides a notification management feature that allows society administrators to send notifications to members for different events, payments, and complaints.

Technology Stack:

The technology stack used to develop the Society Management System includes PHP, MySQL, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. PHP is a popular server-side scripting language that is widely used for web application development. MySQL is an open-source relational database management system that is used to store and retrieve data. Bootstrap 5 is used to create the user interface of the system, while JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the system.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the Society Management System is a comprehensive solution for managing society affairs. The system provides essential features such as member registration, event management, fee management, complaint handling, visitor management, and notification management. The use of PHP and MySQL as the technology stack provides a robust and scalable platform for future development. With the installation process being relatively easy, society administrators can get up and running in no time. The Society Management System can streamline the management process and make it more efficient, saving valuable time and resources.
